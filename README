Sidebar Plugin
========

A simple plugin that will provide you with some helpers to use a sidebar in your app.

== INSTALLATION

1. run rake sidebar:install
2. it will generate a views/sidebars directory
3. make a views/sidebars/_global.rhtml file, this will be the app-wide sidebar
   file.
4. anywhere in your layout ()where you want to insert your sidebar) or view file   insert the following:
   <%= display_sidebar %>

== USAGE

1. run rake sidebar:generate FOR='controller/action'
    EX: rake sidebar:generate FOR='users/new' # => this sidebar will show up
    when you are requesting for users/new
2. if you are on osx and are using textmate, you are in luck, it will 
   automatically open the new sidebar file in textmate

== THINGS TO KNOW

1. sidebar will search for sidebars in the following places in the following
   order:
   - sidebars/[controller]/_[action].rhtml #=> view specific sidebar
   - sidebars/[controller]/_global.rhtml #=> controller specific sidebar
   - sidebars/_global.rhtml #=> app-wide specific sidebar
