Sidebar Plugin
==============

A simple plugin that will provide you with some helpers to use a sidebar in your app.

== INSTALLATION

1. run rake sidebar:install
2. it will generate a views/sidebars directory
3. make a views/sidebars/_global.rhtml file, this will be the app-wide sidebar
   file.
4. anywhere in your layout (where you want to insert your sidebar) or view file   insert the following:
   <%= display_sidebar %>

== USAGE

1. run rake sidebar:generate FOR='controller/action'
    EX: rake sidebar:generate FOR='users/new' # => this sidebar will show up
    when you are requesting for users/new
2. if you are on osx and are using textmate, you are in luck, it will 
   automatically open the new sidebar file in textmate
3. you can pass a message to display (through the block) if the sidebar isn't
   found:
   EX: display_sidebar { "No sidebars" } # => Displays "No sidebars" if the
   sidebar for the controller/action isn't found.

== THINGS TO KNOW

1. sidebar will search for sidebars in the following places in the following
   order:
   # sidebars/[controller]/_[action].rhtml #=> view specific sidebar
   # sidebars/[controller]/_global.rhtml #=> controller specific sidebar
   # sidebars/_global.rhtml #=> app-wide specific sidebar
   
2. if the controller/action pattern doesn't work out for you or you need 2/3 actions to
   share the same the sidebar, you can use the copy_from method to help you out...
   EX: copy_from :show # => copies the sidebar from the show action

   EX: copy_from :show, :controller => :dashboard 
   # => render :partial => 'sidebars/dashboard/show'
   
3. If you want to wrap the sidebar with an element, you can pass the :inside
   option:

   EX: display_sidebar :inside => '<div id="sidebar">yield</div>'
   # => yield is where the sidebar content will be put into
